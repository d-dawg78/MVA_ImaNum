#### Abstract:

(Google translated from French to English)

In this project, we explore the field of underwater image restoration. These images are often blued. Colors are therefore less visible there, which can have an impact on tasks such as object recognition and image segmentation. We have implemented three algorithms. The first was published by Bianco et al. in 2015 [3]. It is based on the correction of the color in the color space lαb and the assumption of a gray world. The other two algorithms are neural networks, both popular in other color correction tasks in digital imaging. We observe that the method of Bianco et al. is much more efficient than our neural networks. Our results have been compared with each other. They have also been compared to those of the Sea-thru [1] algorithm, a benchmark in the field.
